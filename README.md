# push_swap

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting.

## Notes

Análise de complexidade nos permite medir o quão rápido um programa executa suas computações.
